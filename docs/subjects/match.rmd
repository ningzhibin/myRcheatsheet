## mapping / match between two list

* quick message: using match 

let's say you have a vector/list, you would like to convert this list (l in this example) to something else according to some mapping relation(df in this example)



-   generate sample data

```{r}
df <- data.frame(from = LETTERS[1:5], to = randomNames::randomNames(5))
l <-sample(LETTERS[1:5], 10, replace = TRUE)

```

-   mapping table:

```{r echo=FALSE}
df

```

-   your target list:

```{r echo=FALSE}
l
```

you can use match to get the index of the element of the first vector in the second vector, like this

```{r}
match(l,df$from)

```

Now you now how to use the mapping. you can either get a data.frame, like this:

```{r}
df[match(l,df$from),]
```

or only get a clean list like this:

```{r}

df[match(l,df$from),2]


```
